* What are CSS selectors?
In CSS, selectors are patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style.

 - Tag, class (. - group of elements), id (# - one element)

 - Naming your CSS selectors. Best Practice (CamelCase, underscore, or snake_case)

* What does this code do?
`p {
  color: red;
  text-align: center;
}`

* Flexbox

A flex container expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow.

* Gridbox

CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.




















 In the CSS, a class selector is a name preceded by a full stop (“.”) and an ID selector is a name preceded by a hash character (“#”). The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.
